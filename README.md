> ... are just like blue/green, but they happen at a much faster rate.

Example:
1. `DNS` -> `LB` -> `ASG1`
2. `DNS` -> `LB` -> `ASG2`

<a name="3_1_9"></a>
### [↖](#3_1)[↑](#3_1_8)[↓](#3_1_10) A/B testing
* Like blue/green deployment, but only shift a percentage of the traffic over, not everything at once
* Gradually increase percentage of traffic sent to the new environment
* Allows for different end goal:
	* *Measuer user feedback* and decide whether a feature should be rolled out or rolled back
	* This can be decided well before the new environment gets 100% of the traffic
	* Could only role out a feature to 10% of the users and switch back after metrics have been
	collected
	* -> different to red/green deployment
* Achieved via *AWS route 53* **weighted routing**

**pros**|**cons**

* A *container* for an IAM *role* that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts.
* An EC2 Instance cannot be assigned a role directly, but it can be assigned an Instance Profile which contains a role.
* If you use the AWS Management Console to create a role for Amazon EC2, the console automatically creates an instance profile and gives it the same name as the role.
* If you manage your roles from the AWS CLI or the AWS API, you create roles and instance profiles as separate actions.

<a name="3_2_2_1"></a>
#### [↖](#3_2)[↑](#3_2_2)[↓](#3_2_2_2) ELB/ALB Logs
* *Access Logging* is an optional feature of Elastic Load Balancing that is disabled by default.
* After you enable access logging for your load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing captures the logs and stores them in the Amazon S3 bucket as compressed files.
* You can disable access logging at any time.
* Can log every 5 or 60 minutes
* There's no additional charge

<a name="3_2_2_2"></a>
#### [↖](#3_2)[↑](#3_2_2_1)[↓](#3_2_2_3) ELB/ALB Health Checks
* If you have associated your Auto Scaling Group with a *Classic Load Balancer*, you can use the load
  balancer health check to determine the health state of instances in your Auto Scaling Group. By
  default, an Auto Scaling Group periodically checks the health state of each instance.
* Your *Application Load Balancer* periodically sends requests to its registered targets to test their
  status. These tests are called health checks.
* The status of the instances that are healthy at the time of the health check is `InService`. The
  status of any instances that are unhealthy at the time of the health check is `OutOfService`.

<a name="3_2_3_1"></a>
#### [↖](#3_2)[↑](#3_2_3)[↓](#3_2_3_2) Overview
*Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling* helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances
available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called
*Auto Scaling Groups*. You can specify the **minimum** number of instances in each Auto Scaling Group,
and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. You can specify
the **maximum** number of instances in each Auto Scaling Group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures
that your group never goes above this size. If you specify the **desired** capacity, either when you
create the group or at any time thereafter, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group has
this many instances. If you specify **scaling policies**, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can launch or
terminate instances as demand on your application increases or decreases.

* Auto scaling can play a major role in deployments
* Need to avoid downtime during deployments
* How long does it take to deploy code and configure an instance?
* How do you test a new launch configuration?
* How do you phase out older launch configurations?
* Use lifecycle hooks for custom actions
* CloudFormation init scripts
* Cloud init scripts
* Scale out/scale in
* Can launch spot instances as well as on-demand instances (also configure ratio between these instance options)
* On AWS: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" target="_blank">Service</a> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/faqs/" target="_blank">FAQs</a> - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" target="_blank">User Guide</a>

<a name="3_2_3_2"></a>
#### [↖](#3_2)[↑](#3_2_3_1)[↓](#3_2_3_2_1) Components

##### Auto Scaling Group
* Contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management
* To use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies

##### Launch Configuration
* Instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling Group uses to launch EC2 instances
* One Launch Configuration per ASG, can be used in many ASGs though
* Can't be modified, needs to be recreated
* To change instance type, copy the old Launch Configuration, change instance type, double *max* and *desired*, wait till new values have propagated, revert *max* and *desired*

##### Launch Template
* Similar to Launch Configuration
* Launch Templates can be used to launch regular instances as well as Spot Fleets.
* Allows to have multiple versions of the same template
* Can source another template to build a hierachy
* With versioning, you can create a subset of the full set of parameters and then reuse it to create other templates or template versions
* AWS recommends to use Launch Templates instead of Launch Configurations to ensure that you can use the latest features of Amazon EC2

##### Termination Policy
* To specify which instances to terminate first during scale in, configure a Termination Policy for the Auto Scaling Group.
* Policies will be applied to the AZ with the most instances
* Can be combined with *instance protection* to prevent termination of specific instances, this starts as soon as the instance is *in service*.
  * Instances can still be terminated manually (unless *termination protection* has been enabled)
  * Unhealthy instance will still be replaced
  * Spot instance interuptions can still occur
	* *Instance protection* can also be applied to an Auto Scaling Group - protecting the whole group: *protect from scale in*
* Can specify *multiple* policies, will be executed in order until an instance has been found
* *Default* policy being last in a list of multiple policies is like `catchAll`, will always find an instance
  * Determine which AZ has most instances and at least one instance that's not protected from scale in
  * [For ASG with multiple instance types and purchase options]: Try to align remaining instances to allocation strategy
  * [For ASG that uses Launch Templates]: Terminate one of the instances with the oldest Launch Template
  * [For ASG that uses Launch Configuration]: Terminate one of the instances with the oldest Launch Configuration
  * If there are multiple instances to choose from, pick the one nearest to the next billing hour
  * Choose one at random

.|.|.
-|-|-
0|**Default**|Designed to help ensure that your instances span Availability Zones evenly for high availability<br/>`3`->`4`->`random`
1|**OldestInstance**|Useful when upgrading to a new EC2 instance type
2|**NewestInstance**|Useful when testing a new launch configuration
3|**OldestLaunchConfiguration**|Useful when updating a group and phasing out instances
5|**OldestLaunchTemplate**|Useful when you're updating a group and phasing out the instances from a previous configuration
4|**ClosestToNextInstanceHour**|Next billing hour - useful to maximize instance us
6|**AllocationStrategy**|Useful when preferred instance types have changed

##### Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hooks
The EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group have a path, or lifecycle, that differs from that of
other EC2 instances. The lifecycle *starts* when the Auto Scaling Group launches an instance and
puts it into service. The lifecycle *ends* when you terminate the instance, or the Auto Scaling
group takes the instance out of service and terminates it.

Allows to cater for applications that take longer to deploy/tear-down.

After Lifecycle Hooks are added to the instance:
* ASG responds to scale-out/scale-in events
* Lifecycle Hook puts instance into `pending:wait`/`terminating:wait` state, instance is paused until we continue or timeout
	* This can be extended by configuring a *heartbeat*
* Custom actions are performed through one or more of these options:
  * CloudWatch Events target to invoke Lambda function
  * Notification target for Lifecycle Hook is defined
  * Script on instance runs as instance starts, script can control lifecycle actions
* Can also notify SQS or SNS, but Lambda is the preferred option
* Going into `pending:proceed`/`terminating:proceed` after that.
* By default, the instance remains in a wait state for one hour, and then the Auto Scaling Group
  continues the launch or terminate process

##### Scaling
Scaling is the ability to increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application. Scaling
starts with an event, or scaling action, which instructs an Auto Scaling Group to either launch or
terminate Amazon EC2 instances.

* Manual scaling
  * Specify min/max/desired
* Scheduled scaling
  * Specify time and date
* Scaling Policies
  * *Target Tracking Scaling Policy*
    * With target tracking scaling policies, you select a scaling metric and set a target value.
    Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling
    policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value.
  * *Simple Scaling Policy*
    * With *simple* and *step* scaling policies, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process.
    * Both require you to create CloudWatch alarms for the scaling policies.
    * Both require you to specify the high and low thresholds for the alarms.
    * Both require you to define whether to add or remove instances, and how many, or set the group to an exact size.
  * *Step Scaling Policy*
    * The main difference between the policy types is the step adjustments that you get with step
    scaling policies. When step adjustments are applied, and they increase or decrease the current
    capacity of your Auto Scaling Group, the adjustments vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
    * We recommend that you use *step scaling policies* instead of *simple scaling policies*, even if you have a single scaling adjustment
  * After a scaling activity is started, the policy continues to respond to additional alarms, even while a scaling activity or health check replacement is in progress.
  * Therefore, all alarms that are breached are evaluated by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling as it receives the alarm messages.
  * However, scaling actions from previous alarms are taken into account (thereby not changing the absolute outcome of the scaling action)
* Predictive scaling
  * AWS using data collection from actual EC2 usage

*Protect* instances from scaling in by setting termination protection, e.g. per API call
  * Long running workers
  * 'Special' instances, e.g. master of a cluster

##### Notifications
* Can send SNS notifications
  * Success/failure on instance launch/termination
* Better to integrate with CloudWatch Events
* No direct integration with CloudWatch Logs
  * However if the CloudWatch agent is installed on the instances they will send logs

##### Health Checks
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can determine the health status of an instance using one or more of the following:
* Status checks provided by Amazon EC2 to identify hardware and software issues that may impair an instance. The default health checks for an Auto Scaling group are EC2 status checks only.
* Health checks provided by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). These health checks are disabled by default but can be enabled.
* Your custom health checks.

#### [↖](#3_2)[↑](#3_2_3_2_8)[↓](#3_2_3_3_1) Integration with other services

##### ALB
`ALB` -> `Target Group` <- `ASG`
* Configure ASG
  * *Target Group* from ALB
  * *Health Check Type* ELB
* Can configure *Slow Start Mode* on Target Group level (up to 15min), so that new instances don't get the full load immediately
* Should redirect from http (80) to https (443)
* Can put instances into *Standby* so that they don't receive traffic.
* Can put instances into *Scale In Protection* so that they don't get terminated on Scale In.

##### CodeDeploy
* Install CodeDeploy agent on instances as per UserData
* Create CodeDeploy *Application* and *Deployment* and tie it to the Auto Scaling Group
  * CodeDeploy will create Deployments for existing and new instances
* Can choose between *in-place* and *blue-green* deployments
  * Blue-green will provision new Auto Scaling Group
    * Must have a load balancer configured so that traffic can be switched over
* When deploying a *new* application version this will not be considered 'latest' until it has succeeded
  * So for Auto Scaling events, the *old* version is still getting deployed

##### CloudFormation
* *CreationPolicy*
  * Wait for notification from instances that they created successfully
  * Instances use `cfn-signal` in UserData section
* *UpdatePolicy*
  * If Launch Configuration or Launch Template are changing, deployed instances will *not* update unless defined in UpdatePolicy
  * Can configure policy for *rolling*, *replacing* and *scheduled* updated

##### SQS
* It's common pattern to have instances from within an ASG consuming messages from SQS
* Can implement custom metric in CloudWatch to control Auto Scaling behaviour
  * E.g. size of individual backlog on instances

#### [↖](#3_2)[↑](#3_2_3_4)[↓](#3_2_3_5_1) Troubleshooting

##### Possible Problems
* Attempting to use wrong subnet
* AZ no longer available or supported (outage)
* Security group does not exist
* Associated keypair does not exist
* Auto scaling configuration is not working correctly
* Instance type specification does not exist in that AZ
* Invalid EBS device mapping
* Attempt to attach EBS block device to instance-store AMI
* AMI issues
* Attempt to use *placement groups* with instance types that don't support that
* AWS running out of capacity in that AZ
* If an instance is stopped, e.g. for updating it, auto scaling will consider it unhealthy and
  terminate - restart it. Need to suspend auto scaling first.

##### Suspending ASG processes
You can suspend and then resume one or more of the scaling processes for your Auto Scaling Group.
This can be useful for investigating a configuration problem or other issues with your web
application and making changes to your application without invoking the scaling processes.

<a name="3_3_1"></a>
### [↖](#3_3)[↑](#3_3)[↓](#3_4) Overview
A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value.
For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. You can
use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a
detailed level. After you activate cost allocation tags, AWS uses the cost allocation tags to
organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to
categorize and track your AWS costs. AWS provides two types of cost allocation tags, an
*AWS generated tags* and *user-defined tags*. AWS defines, creates, and applies the AWS generated
tags for you, and you define, create, and apply user-defined tags. You must activate both types of tags
separately before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report.

### [↖](#4_1)[↑](#4_1)[↓](#4_2) Overview
Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as
Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. By using these
frameworks and related open-source projects, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig, you can process
data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. Additionally, you can use Amazon
EMR to transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and database,
such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.

Use cases:
* Machine learning
* Extract transform load (ETL)
* Clickstream analysis (from S3, using Apache Spark and Apache Hive)
* Real-time streaming
* Interactive analytics
* Genomics

Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and
compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications
for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment,
Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity.
These findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed assessment reports which are
available via the Amazon Inspector console or API.

Amazon Inspector security assessments help you check for unintended network accessibility of your
Amazon EC2 instances and for vulnerabilities on those EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector assessments
are offered to you as pre-defined rules packages mapped to common security best practices and
vulnerability definitions. Examples of built-in rules include checking for access to your EC2
instances from the internet, remote root login being enabled, or vulnerable software versions
installed. These rules are regularly updated by AWS security researchers.

* **Network Assessments**
  * Does not require agent
* **Host Assessments**
  * Requires agent
* Can automate assessments via scheduled CloudWatch Events
  * Can use tag to find instances to asses
  * Cannot launch AMI, requires instance
* Assessment templates can notify SNS
  * Could trigger Lambda to remediate EC2 findings via SSM documents

*Amazon API Gateway* is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish,
maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console,
you can create *REST* and *WebSocket* APIs that act as a “front door” for applications to access data,
business logic, or functionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time
communication applications.

<a name="4_3_2"></a>
### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_1_1)[↓](#4_3_2_1) Concepts

<a name="4_3_2_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2)[↓](#4_3_2_2) Endpoint
A hostname for an API in API Gateway that is deployed to a specific region. The hostname is of the
form `{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com`.

The following types of API endpoints are supported:
* *Regional* - deployed to the specified region and intended to serve clients in the same AWS region.
* *Edge Optimized* - deployed to the specified region while using a *CloudFront distribution* to facilitate client access typically from across AWS regions
* *Private* - exposed through interface VPC endpoints

<a name="4_3_2_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2_1)[↓](#4_3_2_3) Stage
A logical reference to a lifecycle state of your REST or WebSocket API (for example, `dev`, `prod`,
`beta`, `v2`).
* API stages are identified by API ID and stage name.
* Each stage has its own configuration parameters.
* Can be rolled back in history.
* Have *stage variables*, that are like environment variables for API Gateway.
  * Can be used to configure enpoints that the stage talks to.
  * Accessible from Lambda context as well.
* Can enable *canary deployments* for a stage (usually `PROD`)
  * Canaray releases attaches a new version to an existing stage deployment and randomly shift traffic over
  * Logs and metrics are generated separately for all canary requests
  * This is blue/green for API Gateway/Lambda

<a name="4_3_2_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2_2)[↓](#4_3_2_4) Deployment
After creating your API, you *must* deploy it to make it callable by your users. To deploy an API,
you create an *API deployment* and associate it with a *stage*. Each stage is a snapshot of the API
and is made available for client apps to call.

<a name="4_3_2_4"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2_3)[↓](#4_3_2_5) Canary Deployments
* Use stage variables for canary deployments
  * Integrate Lambda via alias: `GetStartedLambdaProxyIntegration:${stageVariables.lambdaAlias}`
  * Overwrite stage variable in canary deployment
* Could also use Lambda's canary functionality with weighted aliases

<a name="4_3_2_5"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2_4)[↓](#4_3_2_6) Integration
* *Lambda Proxy* - request is passed through straight to a Lambda
  * Proxy Lambda deals with complete `http` request
* *Lambda Non-Proxy/Custom*
  * Allows integration of *mapping template*
  * Can transform request as well as response
  * Allows to evolve the API while keeping Lambda function static
* *Any service*
  * **All** AWS services support dedicated APIs to expose their features. However, the application
  protocols or programming interfaces are likely to differ from service to service. An API Gateway
  API with the AWS integration has the advantage of providing a consistent application protocol
  for your client to access different AWS services.

<a name="4_3_2_6"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2_5)[↓](#4_3_2_7) Mapping Template
* A scripts in Velocity Template Language (VTL) that transforms a request body from the frontend
data format to the backend data format.
* Cannot add default values to fields, only add new static fields

<a name="4_3_2_7"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2_6)[↓](#4_3_2_8) Model
A data schema specifying the data structure of a request or response payload.

<a name="4_3_2_8"></a>
#### [↖](#4_3)[↑](#4_3_2_7)[↓](#4_4) Throttling
* Account-wide limit of 10,000 requests per second.
  * Applies at service/account level
* Can create *usage plan*:
  * *Rate*, *burst*, *quota*
  * Can assoicate with stage/method/API key (to limit certain clients)

### [↖](#4_4)[↑](#4_4)[↓](#4_5) Overview
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3
using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay
only for the queries that you run.

Athena is easy to use. Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start
querying using standard SQL. Most results are delivered within seconds. With Athena, there’s no
need for complex ETL jobs to prepare your data for analysis. This makes it easy for anyone with
SQL skills to quickly analyze large-scale datasets.

Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing you to create a unified
metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate
your Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema versioning.

### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5)[↓](#4_5_2) Overview
*AWS CloudFormation* provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the
infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. CloudFormation allows you to use a simple text
file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your
applications across all regions and accounts. This file serves as the single source of truth for
your cloud environment.

AWS CloudFormation is available at no additional charge, and you pay only for the AWS resources
needed to run your applications.

* Allows to create and provision **resources** in a reusable **template** fashion
* Declarative - no need for ordering and orchestration
* Separation of concerns - different stacks for different purposes
* On AWS: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">Service</a> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/faqs/" target="_blank">FAQs</a> - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html" target="_blank">User Guide</a>

#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_2)[↓](#4_5_2_1_1) Template
A *CloudFormation* template is a `JSON` or `YAML` formatted text file

Element|Comment
-|-
`AWSTemplateFormatVersion`|` 2010-09-09`
`Description`|.
`Metadata`|Details about the template
`Parameters`|Values to pass in right before template creation
`Mappings`|Maps keys to values (eg different values for different regions)
`Conditions`|Check values before deciding what to do
`Resources`|Creates resources - only mandatory section in a template
`Outputs`|Values to be exposed from the console or from API calls

##### Parameters
* Type: `String`, `Number`, `List`, `CommaDelimitedList`, AWS-specific types like `AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName`, SSM-Parameter key (`AWS::SSM::Parameter`)
  * SSM *SecureString* is not supported
* *Description*, *Default Value*, *Allowed Values*, *Allowed Pattern*
* Validation: *regular expression*/*MinLength*/*MaxLength*/*MinValue*/*MaxValue*
* Can set `NoEcho` for secrets, will be masked with `****`
* Can set `UsePreviousValue` for stack updates
* *Pseudo parameters* are parameters that are predefined by AWS CloudFormation. You do not declare them in your template. Use them the same way as you would a parameter, as the argument for the Ref function.
  * `AWS::AccountId`, `AWS::NotificationARNs`, `AWS::NoValue`, `AWS::Partition`, `AWS::Region`, `AWS::StackId`, `AWS::StackName`, `AWS::URLSuffix`
* Reference a parameter within the template `!Ref myParam`
* Usage of parameters *might* make it hard to instantiate stacks

##### Mappings
* Fixed (hardcoded) variables within CloudFormation template
```
  RegionMap:
    us-east-1:
      HVM64: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
      HVMG2: ami-0a584ac55a7631c0c
    us-west-1:
      HVM64: ami-0bdb828fd58c52235
      HVMG2: ami-066ee5fd4a9ef77f1
...
  myEC2Instance:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      ImageId: !FindInMap [RegionMap, !Ref "AWS::Region", HVM64]
```

##### Conditions
```
Conditions:
  CreateProdResources: !Equals [ !Ref EnvType, prod ]
```
* Can use (and combine) `Fn::And`, `Fn::Equals`, `Fn::If`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::Or`

##### Resources
* Over 220 types of resources, `AWS::aws-product-name::data-type-name`
* AWS figures out creation, update and delete of resources for us
  * Update can impact a resource in 4 possible ways
    * *No interruption*
      * E.g. change `ProvisionedThroughput` of a DynamoDB table
    * *Some interruption*
      * E.g. change `InstanceType` of an EC2 instance
    * *Replacement*
      * E.g. change `AvailabilityZone` of an EC2 instance
      * E.g. change `ImageId` of an EC2 instance
      * E.g. change `Tablename` of a DynamoDB table
* Can toggle creation with `Condition`:
	```
	Resources:
		MountPoint:
		Type: "AWS::EC2:VolumeAttachment"
		Condition: CreateProdResources
	```

##### Outputs
* Can be
	* constructed value/parameter reference/pseudo parameter/output from a function like `fn::getAtt` or `Ref`
* Can be used in a different stack (*cross stack references*)
  * `!ImportValue NameOfTheExport`
  * Cannot delete stack if its outputs are used in another stack

##### Intrinsic Functions
* Used to pass in values that are not available until runtime
* Usable in `resources`, `outputs`, `metadata` attributes and `update policy` attributes (auto
scaling). You can also use intrinsic functions to conditionally create stack resources.
* Most intrinsic functions have a short and a long form (not `Ref`):
	* `Fn::GetAtt: [ logicalNameOfResource, attributeName ]`
	* `!GetAtt logicalNameOfResource.attributeName`

Name|Attributes|Description
-|-|-
`Ref`| *logicalName* | * Returns the *default* value of the specified *parameter*. For *resource* typically physical id
`Fn::Base64`| *valueToEncode* | * Provides encoding, converts from plain text into base64
`Fn::Cidr`| *ipBlock*, *count*, *cidrBits* | * Returns an array of CIDR address blocks. The number of CIDR blocks returned is dependent on the count parameter
`Fn::FindInMap`| *MapName*, *TopLevelKey*, *SecondLevelKey* | * Returns the value corresponding to keys in a two-level map that is declared in the *Mappings* section
`Fn::GetAtt`| *logicalNameOfResource*, *attributeName*| * Returns the value of an attribute from an object, either the default or the specified attribute<br/>* Object is either from the same or a nested template
`Fn::GetAZs`| *region*| * Returns an array that lists *Availability Zones* for a specified region<br/> * If region is omitted return AZs from the region the template is applied in
`Fn::If`| *boolean*, *string1*, *string2*| *	Returns `string1` if `boolean` is `true`, `string2` otherwise
`Fn::And`, `Fn::Equals`, `Fn::Or`, `Fn::Not`|.|* Good for `condition` element
`Fn::ImportValue`| *sharedValueToImport* | * Returns the value of an *Output* exported by another stacki<br/> * You can't delete a stack if another stack references one of its outputs.<br/> * You can't modify or remove an output value that is referenced by another stack.
`Fn::Join`| *delimiter*, [ *comma-delimited list of values* ] | * Joins a set of values into a single value separated by the specified delimiter
`Fn::Select`| *index*, *listOfObjects*| * Returns a single object from a list of objects by index
`Fn::Split`| *delimiter*, *source string* | * Split a string into a list of string values so that you can select an element from the resulting
`Fn::Sub`| - *String*<br/> - { *key*: *Value*, ... } | * Substitutes variables in an input string with values that you specify string list<br/>Also: `!Sub 'arn:aws:ec2:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:vpc/${vpc}'`
`Fn::Transform`| Name: *String*<br/> Parameters:<br/>   { *key*: *Value*, ... } | * Specifies a macro to perform custom processing on part of a stack template

#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_2_1_6)[↓](#4_5_2_3) Stacks
* Related resources are managed in a single unit called a **stack**
	* All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's *CloudFormation* template
	* Controls lifecycle of managed resources
	* Stack has `name` & `id`
  * Can be updated *directly* or via *change set*
  * Will **rollback** stack if it fails to create (can be disabled via API/console)
  * Possible to detect **stack drift**, if supported by created rersources
  * Can enable **termination protection**
  * Can send *stack events* to SNS topic
* A **stack policy** is an *IAM*-style policy statements that governs who can do what
  * Defines which actions can be performed on specified resources.
  * With CloudFormation stack policies you can protect all or certain resources in your stacks from being unintentionally updated or
  deleted during the update process.

  * Check **stack policy** if updates are allowed
    * No policy present: All updates are allowed -> This differs from IAM default!
    * Once a policy is applied
      * It cannot be updated or removed from the stack (deleted)
      * *All* resources that are not explicitely allowed are denied
      * Default deny can be explicitely overwritten
    * Policy format JSON
      * Contains *policy documents*
  * Don't confuse with `DeletionPolicy`, `UpdatePolicy`, `UpdateRollbackPolicy` attributes

Element|.
-|-
`Effect`|.
`Principal`|*Must* be wildcard for stack policies
`Action`|`Update:Modify`,`Update:Replace`,`Update:Delete`,`Update:(wildcard)`
`Resource`,`NotResource`|.
`Condition`|Typically evaluates based on resource type

<a name="4_5_2_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_2_2)[↓](#4_5_2_3_1) Processes

##### Stack Creation
1. Template upload into S3 bucket
2. Template syntax check
    * CloudFormation will check for any IAM resources being created, and require `CAPABILITY_IAM`|
    `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` if so
    * Will raise `InsufficientCapabilities` otherwise
3. Stack name & parameter verification & ingestion (apply default values)
4. Template processing & stack creation
	* **Resource ordering**
      * *Natural ordering*
        * CloudFormation knows about 'natural' dependencies between resources.
      * *DependsOn*
        * Also `DependsOn` attribute
        * Allows to direct *CloudFormation* on how to handle more complex dependencies
        * Applies to *creation* as well as *deletion* & *rollback*
        * `DependsOn` can be a single resource or a list of resources
        * Will error on circular dependencies
        * `DependsOn` is problematic if the target resource needs more complex setup than just stack creation
      * -> *Wait conditions* allow further control about what happens when
	* **Resource creation**
		* Will try to create as many resources as possible in parallel
		* Includes pausing and waiting for other resources to be created first
		* Associate the `CreationPolicy` attribute with a resource to prevent its status from reaching
		create complete until AWS CloudFormation receives a specified number of success signals or the
		timeout period is exceeded.
	* **Output creation**
5. Stack completion or rollback
	* Rollback settings can be provided while creating the stack
		* `onFailure` - `ROLLBACK` | `DELETE` | `DO_NOTHING`
    * Can try to manually resolve problems if in state `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`

##### Stacks Updates
* **Direct updates**
	* You submit changes and AWS CloudFormation immediately deploys them
* **Change sets**
	* You can preview the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack, and then decide whether
	to apply those changes by executing the change set
	* *Change sets* are JSON-formatted documents that summarize the changes AWS CloudFormation will
	make to a stack
* Use the `UpdatePolicy` attribute to specify how AWS CloudFormation handles updates to the `AWS:
	AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup`, `AWS::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup`, `AWS::Elasticsearch::Domain`
	or `AWS::Lambda::Alias` resources.
	* Values depend on resource type, e.g. ASG replacing vs rolling update
* Use the `UpdateReplacePolicy` attribute to retain or (in some cases) backup the existing
	physical instance of a resource when it is replaced during a stack update operation.
* On Failure, the stack will rollback automatically to the last known working state
* **Interuption while updating**
  * Update can impact a resource in 3 possible ways
    * *No interruption*
      * E.g. change `ProvisionedThroughput` of a DynamoDB table
    * Some interruption
      * E.g. change `EbsOptimized` of an EC2 instance (EBS-backed)
      * E.g. change `InstanceType` of an EC2 instance (EBS-backed)
    * Replacement
      * E.g. change `AvailabilityZone` of an EC2 instance
      * E.g. change `ImageId` of an EC2 instance
      * E.g. change `Tablename` of a DynamoDB table

##### Stack Deletion
* Specify the stack to delete, and AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack and all the resources in that stack.
* With the `DeletionPolicy` attribute you can preserve or (in some cases) backup a resource when its
  stack is deleted.
* If AWS CloudFormation cannot delete a resource, the stack will not be deleted.
* A stack can have *termination protection* enabled, which will prevent it from being deleted accidentally
* **Resource Deletion policy**
  * **Policy**/statement that is associated with every resource of a stack
  * Controls what happens if stack is deleted
  * `DeletionPolicy`
    * `Delete`
      * (default)
      * Creates transitive environment - immutable architecture
    * `Retain`
      * Obviously needs further cleanup - non-immutable architecture
    * `Snapshot`
      * Takes snapshot prior to deletion
      * Some resourcetypes only
        * `AWS::EC2::Volume`
        * `AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster`
        * `AWS::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup`
        * `AWS::Neptune::DBCluster`
        * `AWS::RDS::DBCluster`
        * `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`
        * `AWS::Redshift::Cluster`
      * Allow data recovery at a later stage

<a name="4_5_2_4"></a>
#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_2_3_3)[↓](#4_5_2_4_1) StackSets
*StackSets* lets you create stacks in multiple AWS *accounts* across multiple *regions* by using a single CloudFormation
template. All the resources included in each stack are defined by the stack set's
AWS CloudFormation template. As you create the stack set, you specify the template to use, as well
as any parameters and capabilities that template requires.
* Can roll out from Organizations master account
  * To all accounts
  * to all accounts of an OU

##### Concept
* Stack sets are created in a region of an administrator account
* A *stack instance* is a reference to a stack in a target account within a region
  * Can exist without a stack, e.g. if stack failed to create, then the stack instance shows the reason for that
* Operations: *Create*, *Update*, *Delete*
* For updates, can choose to overwrite parameters only for some accounts/regions

Operation options|.
-|-
*Maximum concurrent accounts*|Maximum number or percentage of target accounts in which an operation is performed at one time
*Failure tolerance*|Maximum number or percentage of stack operation failures that can occur, per region, beyond which AWS CloudFormation stops an operation automatically
*Retain stack* (delete operations only)|Keep stacks and their resources running even after they have been removed from a stack set

<a name="4_5_3_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_3)[↓](#4_5_3_1_1) Running code on instance boot

Script Name|Purpose
-|-
`cfn-init`|Use to retrieve and interpret resource metadata, install packages, create files, and start services.
`cfn-signal`|Use to signal with a CreationPolicy or WaitCondition, so you can synchronize other resources in the stack when the prerequisite resource or application is ready.
`cfn-get-metadata`|Use to retrieve metadata for a resource or path to a specific key.
`cfn-hup`|Use to check for updates to metadata and execute custom hooks when changes are detected.

##### Define code and scripts to run
* **CloudFormation User Data**
	* Scripts and commands to be passed to a launching EC2 instance.
	* Failing user data scripts don't fail the CFN stack
	* Logged to `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`
	* Needs to be base64-encoded
```
UserData:
  Fn::Base64: |
        #!/bin/bash -x
        ...
```
* **cfn-init**
	* Use the AWS::CloudFormation::Init type to include *metadata* on an Amazon EC2 instance for the cfn
		init helper script. If your template calls the `cfn-init` script, the script looks for resource
		metadata rooted in the `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` metadata key.
	* Different sections: `packages`, `groups`, `users`, `sources`, `files`, `commands`, `services`
	* Need to make sure `aws-cfn-bootstrap` is in place und up to date
	* Logged to `/var/log/cfn-init.log`
	* Can use *WaitCondition*/`cfn-signal` to make CloudFormation wait for successful finish of code
* By default, user data scripts and cloud-init directives run only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance.
* Can use `cfn-hup` to detect changes in resource metadata and run user-specified actions when a change is detected
* Use `cfn-get-metadata` to fetch a metadata block from AWS CloudFormation and print it to standard out

##### Signal outcome of installation back to CFN
**Creation Policy**
* Can (only) be used for *EC2 Instances* and *Auto Scaling Groups*
* Creation policy definion
  * Defines desired signal count & waiting period
* Signal configuration
  * Call to `cfn-signal` from EC2 user-data
```
AutoScalingGroup:
  Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
  Properties:
    ...
  CreationPolicy:
    ResourceSignal:
      Count: '3'
      Timeout: PT15M

LaunchConfig:
  Type: AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration
  Properties:
    ...
    UserData:
      "Fn::Base64":
        !Sub |
          #!/bin/bash -xe
          yum update -y aws-cfn-bootstrap
          /opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal -e $? --stack ${AWS::StackName} --resource AutoScalingGroup --region ${AWS::Region}
```
**Wait Conditions and Handlers**
* For other resources (*external* to the stack)
* Wait condition handler
  * *CloudFormation* resource with no properties
  * Generates *signed URL* to communicate success or failure
  * URL can be used by `cfn-signal` to send data to
    * Takes custom data as well
* Wait condition
  * Links handler and resource
    * Know which resource they depend on
    * Hold reference to handler
    * Have response timeout
    * Have a desired count (defaults to 1)
  * Allows to define complex wait order
```
WebServerGroup:
  Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
  Properties:
    ...
WaitHandle:
  Type: AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle
WaitCondition:
  Type: AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition
  DependsOn: "WebServerGroup"
  Properties:
    Handle:
      Ref: "WaitHandle"
    Timeout: "300"
    Count:
      Ref: "WebServerCapacity"
```
<a name="4_5_3_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_3_1_2)[↓](#4_5_3_3) Custom Resources
* Problems with existing *CloudFormation* resources:
	* Sometimes lacks behind AWS services
	* Cannot deal with non-AWS resources
	* Cannot do much logic beyond the scope of intrinsic functions
	* Cannot interact with external services
* Solvable with custom resources:
	* Custom resource type that is backed by *SNS* or *Lambda*
		* `Type: Custom::NameOfResourceType`
		* `ServiceToken: arnOfSnsOrLambda`
	* If stack is *created*, *updated* or *deleted* a payload is sent to `ServiceToken`
		* Payload contains any custom data that's defined with the resource together with the action type
		* This invokes a *Lambda* that performs any sort of custom action
    * Or an *SNS topic*, e.g. to communicate with on-prem resources
		* Returns outcome of operation back to *CloudFormation*, typically includes custom data as well

<a name="4_5_3_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_3_2)[↓](#4_5_3_4) Drift detection
* Can detect drift on an entire stack or on a particular resource
	* Not supported by all resources types
* CloudFormation
	* Compares the current stack configuration to the one specified in the template that was used to create or update the stack
	* Reports on any differences, providing you with detailed information on each one.

<a name="4_5_3_4"></a>
#### [↖](#4_5)[↑](#4_5_3_3)[↓](#4_5_4) Stacks Nesting
* *Resources* in a stack can be references by other stacks
* How to nest
	* Declare resources as `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`
	* Point `TemplateURL` to S3 URL of nested stack
	* Use `Parameters` to provide the nested stack with input values (defaults will be used otherwise)
	* Output values of nested stack are returned to parent (root) stack
		* `!GetAtt nestedStack.Outputs.db_name`
* Benefits
	* Allows infrastructure to be split over many templates
	* Allows infrastructure reuse
	* Allows to workaround limitations like max resources or max template size
	* Considered best practice by AWS

### [↖](#4_6)[↑](#4_6)[↓](#4_6_2) Overview
Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web
content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your
content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests
content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides
the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
* CloudFront is usually the *cheapest* and *simplest* way to add caching to web application

<a name="4_6_2"></a>
### [↖](#4_6)[↑](#4_6_1)[↓](#4_7) Lamdba@Edge
Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your
application, which improves performance and reduces latency. With Lambda@Edge, you don't have to
provision or manage infrastructure in multiple locations around the world. You pay only for the
compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

With Lambda@Edge, you can enrich your web applications by making them globally distributed and
improving their performance — all with zero server administration. Lambda@Edge runs your code in
response to events generated by the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN). Just upload
your code to AWS Lambda, which takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with
high availability at an AWS location closest to your end user.

* `Master Lambda`, associated with `CloudFront distribution trigger` -> `Edge replica`
* Can use Lambda@Edge for A/B testing

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk
auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain
account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event
history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console,
AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security
analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting. In addition, you can use CloudTrail to
detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts. These capabilities help simplify operational
analysis and troubleshooting.

CloudTrail is enabled by default in every account. All activities in an AWS account are being
recorded as CloudTrail events.

actionable insights to monitor your applications, understand and respond to system-wide
performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.
CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events,
providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications and services that run on AWS, and
on-premises servers. You can use CloudWatch to set high resolution alarms, visualize logs and
metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to
optimize your applications, and ensure they are running smoothly.

* Access all your data from a single platform
* Easiest way to collect custom and granular metrics for AWS resources
* Visibility across your applications, infrastructure, and services
* Improve total cost of ownership

#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_2)[↓](#4_9_2_1_1) CloudWatch Logs
* *Log events* are records of some activity recorded by the application or resource being monitored
* *Log streams* are sequences of log events from the same source
* *Log groups* are groups of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings
* *Metric filters* allow to extract metric observations from ingested events and transform them to data points in a CloudWatch metric
  * Search for and match terms, phrases, or values in log events
  * Can increment the value of a CloudWatch metric
* *Retention settings* can be used to specify how long log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs
  Default: Indefinetely
* Logs can be exported to S3 for durable storage.
  * This can be automated with `EventsFilter` -> `Lambda`

##### Subscriptions
* Allow real-time delivery of log events
* Can create subscription filter for *Lambda*, *Elasticsearch*, *Kinesis Data/Firehose* (not supported from console)
  * Only Kinesis Stream supports cross-account
    * Need to establish *log data sender* and *log data recipient*.
    * The log group and the destination must be in the same AWS region. However, the AWS resource
    that the destination points to can be located in a different region.

#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_2_1_2)[↓](#4_9_2_3) CloudWatch Metrics
**Namespaces**
* Container for CloudWatch metrics
* Metrics in different namespaces are isolated from each other
* The AWS namespaces typically use the following naming convention: `AWS/service`

**Metrics**
* Metrics are the fundamental concept in CloudWatch Metrics
* A metric represents a time-ordered set of *data points* that are published to CloudWatch.
* Available metrics are based on currently used service
* Not everything is available out of the box, e.g. no data on memory usage of EC2 instances
* Can also create *Custom Metrics*
  * Publish individual *data points* via AWS CLI or API
  * Exist only in the region where they were created
  * Expire after 15 months if no data is published
  * `aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name PageViewCount --namespace MyService --value 2 --timestamp 2016-10-20T12:00:00.000Z`
* Can also *export* metrics
  * `get-metric-statistics --namespace <value> --metric-name <value> --start-time <value> --end-time <value>...`
* Metrics produced by AWS services are standard resolution by default.
  * When you publish a custom metric, you can define it as either *standard* resolution or *high* resolution.
  * When you publish a high-resolution metric, CloudWatch stores it with a resolution of 1 second,
  and you can read and retrieve it with a period of 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds,
  or any multiple of 60 seconds.
  * Higher resolution data automatically aggregates into lower resolution data

Resolution|Data retention
-|-
<60s|3h
60s|15d
300s (5min)|63d
3600s (1h)|15m

**Time Stamps**
* Each metric data point must be associated with a time stamp.
* Can be up to two weeks in the past and up to two hours into the future.

**Dimension**
* A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric.
* You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric.
* Every metric has specific characteristics that describe it, and you can think of dimensions as categories for those characteristics.
* For example 'ec2 instance id'

**Statistics**
* Statistics are metric data aggregations over specified periods of time
* Average, Sum, Minimum, Maximum, Sample Count, pNN.NN (value of specified percentile)
* Can be computed for any time periods between 60-seconds and 1-day

**Period**
* The length of time associated with a specific Amazon CloudWatch statistic

**Aggregation**
* CloudWatch aggregates statistics according to the period length that you specify when retrieving statistics

#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_2_2)[↓](#4_9_2_3_1) CloudWatch Alarms
* Based on thresholds defined on metrics, including custom metrics
  * Can only be based on a *single* metric
* Can trigger *Lambda*, *SNS*, email, ...
  * Also *Auto Scaling* or *EC2* action
  * Alarms do *not* raise CloudWatch Events themselves
* *High resolution alarms* down to 10 seconds
* Takes place once, at a specific point in time
  * Disable with `mon-disable-alarm-actions` via CLI
* Can be added to dashboard
* Using *alarm actions*, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your EC2 instances.

##### Billing Alarms
* Notfications on billing metrics
* Only available in *us-east-1*

<a name="4_9_2_4"></a>
#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_2_3_1)[↓](#4_9_2_4_1) CloudWatch Events
* Define actions on things that happened
* Or schedule `cron`-based events
* Events are recorded constantly over time
  * *Targets* process events
    * Lambda functions
    * Amazon EC2 instances
    * Streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
    * Delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    * Log groups in Amazon CloudWatch Logs
    * Amazon ECS tasks
    * Systems Manager Run Command
    * Systems Manager Automation
    * AWS Batch jobs
    * AWS Step Functions state machines
    * Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline
    * AWS CodeBuild projects
    * Amazon Inspector assessment templates
    * Amazon SNS topics
    * Amazon SQS queues
    * Built-in targets: EC2 CreateSnapshot API call, EC2 RebootInstances API call, EC2 StopInstances API call, and EC2 TerminateInstances API call
    * The default event bus of another AWS account
  * *Rules* match incoming events and route them to targets
    * CloudTrail integration allows to trigger events on API calls
      * ReadOnly calls (`List*`, `Get*`, `Describe*`) are not supported
  * E.g. CodeCommit automatically triggers CodePipeline on new commits
* Can deliver cross-account
  * Must be in the same region

##### EventBridge
* CloudWatch Events in its core
* Adding other (3rd party service partners) event sources into the mix

##### S3 Events
* On bucket events send to SNS, SQS or Lambda
  * Not everything is covered by S3 notifications
  * Only object-level operations, not bucket-level
* Can also integrate with CloudTrail, but need a trail configured for that bucket

<a name="4_9_2_5"></a>
#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_2_4_2)[↓](#4_9_3) Dashboards
* Customizable home pages in the CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a single correlated view
* Even those resources that are spread across different Regions.
* You can use CloudWatch dashboards to create customized views of the metrics and alarms for your AWS resources.

<a name="4_9_3"></a>
### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_2_5)[↓](#4_9_4) Unified CloudWatch Agent

  * EC2 instances (Linux/Windows)
  * On-Prem instances (Linux/Windows)
* Stores configuration in SSM parameters
  * Easy to share
  * Can configure CloudWatch Agent to boot *directly* from SSM parameter store
* Offers a variety of metrics on top of the EC2 standard metrics

<a name="4_9_4"></a>
### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_3)[↓](#4_9_4_1) Key metrics

<a name="4_9_4_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_4)[↓](#4_9_4_2) EC2
* EC2 metrics are based on what is exposed to the hypervisor.
* *Basic Monitoring* (default) submits values every 5 minutes, *Detailed Monitoring* every minute

Metric|Effect
-|-
`CPUUtilization`|The total CPU resources utilized within an instance at a given time.
`DiskReadOps`,<br/>`DiskWriteOps`|The number of read (write) operations performed on all instance store volumes. This metric is applicable for instance store-backed AMI instances.
`DiskReadBytes`,<br/>`DiskWriteBytes`|The number of bytes read (written) on all instance store volumes. This metric is applicable for instance store-backed AMI instances.
`NetworkIn`,<br/>`NetworkOut`|The number of bytes received (sent) on all network interfaces by the instance
`NetworkPacketsIn`,<br/>`NetworkPacketsOut`|The number of packets received (sent) on all network interfaces by the instance

#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_4_1)[↓](#4_9_4_3) Auto Scaling Group
Metric|Effect
-|-
`GroupMinSize`<br/>`GroupMinSize`|The minimum/maximum size of the Auto Scaling Group.
`GroupDesiredCapacity`|The number of instances that the Auto Scaling Group attempts to maintain.
`GroupInServiceInstances`<br/>`GroupPendingInstances`<br/>`GroupStandbyInstances`<br/>`GroupTerminatingInstances`|The number of instances that are running/pending (not yet in service)/standby (still running)/ terminating as part of the Auto Scaling Group.
`GroupTotalInstances`|The total number of instances in the Auto Scaling Group. This metric identifies the number of instances that are in service, pending, and terminating.

<a name="4_9_4_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_9)[↑](#4_9_4_2)[↓](#4_9_4_4) ELB
Metric|Effect
-|-
`Latency`|Time it takes to receive an response. Measure `max` and `average`
`BackendConnectionErrorr`|Number of not successfully established connections to registered instances, measure `sum` and look at difference between `min` and `max`
`SurgeQueueLength`|Total number of request waiting to get routed, look at `max` and `average`
`SpilloverCount`|Dropped requests because of exceeded surge queue. Look at `sum`
`HTTPCode_ELB_4XX`<br/>`HTTPCode_ELB_5XX`|The number of HTTP XXX server error codes that originate from the *load balancer*. This count does *not* include any response codes generated by the targets. Look at `sum`
`HTTPCode_Backend_2XX`...<br/>...`HTTPCode_Backend_5XX`|The number of HTTP XXX server error codes that originate from the *backend*. Look at `sum`
`RequestCount`|Number of completed requests
`HealthyHostCount`,`UnhealthyHostCount`|Self explainatory

* Elastic Load Balancing reports metrics only when requests are flowing through the load balancer. If there are requests flowing through the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing measures and sends its metrics in 60-second intervals.

> spillover and surge queue give an indication of the ELB being overloaded

* Typically this means that the backend system cannot process requests as fast as they are coming in
  * Ideally load balance into an Auto Scaling Group.

*AWS CodeBuild* is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, Runs
tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you don’t need to
provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild scales continuously and processes
multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue. You can get started
quickly by using prepackaged build environments, or you can create custom build environments that
use your own build tools. With CodeBuild, you are charged by the minute for the compute resources
you use.
* Provides preconfigured environments for supported versions of Java, Ruby, Python, Go, Node.js, Android, .NET Core, PHP, and Docker
* Build images are *Amazon Linux 2*, *Ubuntu 18.04*, *Windows Server Core 2016*
	* Can use build image from ECR, even cross-account

<a name="4_11_3"></a>
### [↖](#4_11)[↑](#4_11_2)[↓](#4_11_3_1) How To

<a name="4_11_3_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_11)[↑](#4_11_3)[↓](#4_11_3_2) Protect branches
Use IAM policy:

```
"Condition": {
		"StringEqualsIfExists": {
				"codecommit:References": [
						"refs/heads/master"
				]
		},
		"Null": {
				"codecommit:References": false
		}
}
```

<a name="4_11_3_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_11)[↑](#4_11_3_1)[↓](#4_11_3_3) Send Notifications
* CodeStar Notifications integration
  * Uses CloudWatch Events Rules under the hood
* Set up notification/notification rules:
	* Pick triggering event (`on commit`, ..., `brunch updated`)
	* Pick SNS topic as target
	* Add subscriber to target
* Set up CloudWatch Events directly:
	* Pick event *source* (AWS service)
	* Pick event *type* (different types, also includes CloudTrail)
	* Pick target (many different types, e.g. Lambda, SNS, SSM, Code*)

<a name="4_11_3_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_11)[↑](#4_11_3_2)[↓](#4_12) Triggers
* Can trigger SNS or Lambda
* Up to 10 triggers
* Can be augmented with custom data (an uninterpreted string) that you can use to distinguish the trigger from others that run for the same event.
* More limited in scope than Notifications. Does not us CloudWatch Events under the hood.

*AWS CodeDeploy* is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a
variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises
servers. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid
downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications.
You can use AWS CodeDeploy to automate software deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone
manual operations. The service scales to match your deployment needs.

* CodeDeploy can be chained into CodePipeline and can use artifacts from there
* CodeDeploy does not provision resources
* Automated deployments
  * EC2, on-prem, (ASG), ECS, (Fargate), Lambda
* Minimize downtime
* Centralized control
* Easy to adopt
* Integrates with AWS SAM

*Create application*|.
*Specify deployment group*|Tags and/or ASG name.
*Specify deployment configuration*|`AllAtOnce`,`HalfAtATime`,`OneAtATime` (default)<br/>*In-place* (default), *Blue/green*
*Upload revison*|.
*Deploy*|.
*Check results*|.
*Redeploy as needed*|.

* **In-place**
  * The application on each instance in the deployment group is stopped
  * The latest application revision is installed
  * The new version of the application is started and validated.
  * You can use a load balancer so that each instance is deregistered during its deployment and then restored to service after the deployment is complete.
  * Only deployments that use the EC2/On-Premises compute platform can use in-place deployments.0

* **Blue/green**
  * Instances are provisioned for the replacement environment.
  * The latest application revision is installed on the replacement instances.
  * An optional wait time occurs for activities such as application testing and system verification.
  * Instances in the *replacement* environment are registered with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, causing traffic to be rerouted to them.
  * Instances in the *original* environment are deregistered and can be terminated or kept running for other uses.
  * If you use an EC2/On-Premises compute platform, be aware that blue/green deployments work with Amazon EC2 instances only.

##### Integration with Elastic Load Balancing
* During deployments, a load balancer prevents internet traffic from being routed to instances when they are not ready, are currently being deployed to, or are no longer needed as part of an environment.
* **Blue/Green Deployments**
  * Allows traffic to be routed to the new instances in a deployment group that the latest application revision has been deployed to (the replacement environment), according to the rules you specify
  * Blocks traffic from the old instances where the previous application revision was running (the original environment).
  * After instances in a replacement environment are registered with a load balancer, instances from the original environment are deregistered and, if you choose, terminated.
  * Specify a Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer in your deployment group.
* **In-Place Deployments**
  * Prevents internet traffic from being routed to an instance while it is being deployed to
  * Makes the instance available for traffic again after the deployment to that instance is complete.
  * If a load balancer isn't used during an in-place deployment, internet traffic may still be directed to an instance during the deployment process.
  * When you use a load balancer with an in-place deployment, instances in a deployment group are deregistered from a load balancer, updated with the latest application revision, and then reregistered with the load balancer as part of the same deployment group after the deployment is successful.
  * Specify a Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer. You can specify the load balancer as part of the deployment group's configuration, or use a script provided by CodeDeploy to implement the load balancer.

##### Integration with Auto Scaling Groups
* When new Amazon EC2 instances are launched as part of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, CodeDeploy can deploy your revisions to the new instances automatically.
* During blue/green deployments on an EC2/On-Premises compute platform, you have two options for adding instances to your replacement (green) environment:
  * Use instances that already exist or that you create manually.
  * Use settings from an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that you specify to define and create instances in a new Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group.
* If an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scale-up event occurs while a deployment is underway, the new instances will be updated with the application revision that was most recently deployed, not the application revision that is currently being deployed.
  * Suspend scaling during rolling deploys
  * Or redeploy

##### Register on-premises instances
* Configure each on-premises instance, register it with CodeDeploy, and then tag it.
	* Can create *IAM User per instance*
		* Needs configuration file with AK/SAK
		* Use `register` or `register-on-premises-instances` command
		* Best for only few instances
	* Can create *IAM Role*
		* Needs credentials to call STS with
		* Best for many instances, also more secure
		* Setup more complicated
		* Use `register-on-premises-instances` command together with STS token service
* Need to install CodeDeploy agent, obviously
* On-prem instances cannot blue/green, as CodeDeploy cannot create new infrastructure

##### Integration with AWS Serverless
* Deploys new versions of your Lambda function, and automatically creates aliases that point to the new version.
* Gradually shifts customer traffic to the new version until you're satisfied that it's working as expected, or you roll back the update.
* Defines pre-traffic and post-traffic test functions to verify that the newly deployed code is configured correctly and your application operates as expected.
* Rolls back the deployment if CloudWatch alarms are triggered.

* Different projection types
	* `KEYS_ONLY` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index
	* `ALL` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index
	* `INCLUDE` - Only the specified table attributes are projected into the index

<a name="4_16_3_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_16)[↑](#4_16_3_1)[↓](#4_16_3_3) Local secondary index
* *Local* as in "co-located on the same partition"
* Uses the *same PK*, but offers different *SK*
* Every partition of a local secondary index is scoped to a base table partition that has the same
  partition key value
* Local secondary indexes are extra tables that DynamoDB keeps in the background
* Can only by created *together* with the base table
* Can choose *eventual consistency* or *strong consistency* at *creation* time
* Can request *not-projected* attributes for query or scan operation
* Consumes read/write throughput from the original table.

<a name="4_16_3_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_16)[↑](#4_16_3_2)[↓](#4_16_4) Global secondary index
* *Global* as in "over many partitions"
* Uses *different PK* and offers additional *SK* (or none).
* *PK* does not have to be unique (unlike base table)
* Queries on the global index can span all of the data in the base table, across all partitions
* Can be created *after* the base table has already been created.
* Only support *eventual consistency*
* Have their own provisioned read/write throughput
* Global secondary keys are distributed transactions across multiple partitions
* Cannot request not-projected attributes for query or scan operation

### [↖](#4_16)[↑](#4_16_4)[↓](#4_16_6) DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for
DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement – from milliseconds to microseconds –
even at millions of requests per second. DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory
acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation,
data population, or cluster management. Now you can focus on building great applications for your
customers without worrying about performance at scale. You do not need to modify application logic,
since DAX is compatible with existing DynamoDB API calls. You can enable DAX with just a few
clicks in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS SDK. Just as with DynamoDB, you only pay for
the capacity you provision.

<a name="4_16_6"></a>
### [↖](#4_16)[↑](#4_16_5)[↓](#4_16_7) DynamoDB Streams

*DynamoDB Streams* captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB
table and stores this information in a log for up to **24 hours**. Applications can access this log
and view the data items as they appeared **before and after** they were modified, in near-real time.

A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB table.
When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to
data items in the table.

* Typically targets Lambda function
  * Only up to 2 Lambda functions on the same stream, throttling issues otherwise
* Underlying implementation is a Kinesis Stream
* Can enable *Global Table*
  * Require DynamoDB streams and empty table
  * Replicate table in different region (*read* and *write*)

<a name="4_16_7"></a>
### [↖](#4_16)[↑](#4_16_6)[↓](#4_17) Global Tables
Amazon DynamoDB global tables provide a fully managed solution for deploying a multi region, multi
master database, without having to build and maintain your own replication solution. With global
tables you can specify the AWS Regions where you want the table to be available. DynamoDB performs
all of the necessary tasks to create identical tables in these Regions and propagate ongoing data
changes to all of them.
* A **global table** is a collection of one or more replica tables, all owned by a single AWS account.
* A **replica table** is a single DynamoDB table that functions as a part
	of a global table. Each replica stores the same set of data items.
* When you create a DynamoDB global table, it consists of multiple replica tables (one per Region)
	that DynamoDB treats as a single unit. Every replica has the same table name and the same primary
	key schema. When an application writes data to a replica table in one Region, DynamoDB propagates
	the write to the other replica tables in the other AWS Regions automatically.
* You can add replica tables to the global table so that it can be available in additional Regions.

  * Created on cluster-level, launch type EC2 or Fargate
  * Can be linked to ALB/NLB/ELB
  * *Service type*
    * *Replica* - places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster
    * *Demon* - deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints
      * Good for e.g. *monitoring* that should run on every container instance
  * *Deployment type*
    * *Rolling*
      * Controlled by Amazon ECS
      * Service scheduler replacing the current running version of the container with the latest version
    * *Blue/Green*
      * Controlled by CodeDeploy
      * Allows to verify a new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it
* **Task Definition**
  * ECS allows to run and maintain a specified number containers in a task definition
    * Group by responsility, e.g. separate task definitions for frontend and backend
  * The task definition is a text file, in JSON format, that describes one or more *containers*, up to a maximum of ten, that form your application
  * Specify various parameters, eg:
    * Container image to use
    * Port to be opened & networking
    * Data volumes
  * Either for ECS or Fargate
* **Container Definitions**
  * Can mark container as *essential* - if that container fails or stops for any reason, all other containers that are part of the task are stopped
* **Task**
  * A *task* is the instantiation of a *task definition* within a cluster
  * If a task should fail or stop, the ECS scheduler launches another instance of the task
    definition to replace it and to maintain the desired count of tasks in service
  * Static host port mapping: Only one task per container instance allowed, e.g. mapping host port 80 to container port
  * Dynamic host port mapping: Uses randomized host ports, can work together with ALB to run multiple task instances per container instance
  * Tasks can have individual IAM roles

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and
services developed with `Java`, `.NET`, `PHP`, `Node.js`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Go`, and `Docker` on familiar servers
such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from
capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same
time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the
underlying resources at any time.

* Allows to *deploy*, *monitor* and *scale* applications quickly
* Focuses on components and performance, not configuration and specification
* Aims to simplify or even remove infrastructure management
* Provides different options for *low cost* and *high availability* quick starts
* Underlying *instances* can be automatically patched
* Platform-specific application *source bundle* (e.g. Java `war` for Tomcat)
  * Go
  * Java SE/with Tomcat
  * .NET on Windows Server with IIS
  * Node.js
  * PHP
  * Python
  * Ruby Stanalone/Puma
  * Docker Single-/Multicontainer - runs on ECS
  * Docker Preconfigured Glassfish/Python/Go

<a name="4_18_2_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_18)[↑](#4_18_2)[↓](#4_18_2_1_1) Components
* **Application**
  * A logical collection of Elastic Beanstalk components, including environments, versions, and environment configurations.
  * An application is conceptually similar to a folder.
  * Either *application* in the traditional sense
  * Or *application component*, e.g. service, frontend, backend
* **Application Version**
  * Refers to a specific, labeled iteration of deployable code for a web application
  * Unique package that represents a version of the *application*
  * Uploaded as a zipped *application source bundle*
  * Each application can have many application versions
  * Can be deployed to one or more *environments* within an application
  * Limit of 1000 version -> can configure application version *lifecycle management*
* **Environment**
  * Collection of AWS resources running an application version
  * Isolated, self-contained set of components of infrastructure
  * Single-instance or multi-instance scalable
  * Application can have multiple environments
    * Either represent *development stages* (PROD, STAGING, ...)
    * ...or *application component*, e.g. service, frontend, backend
  * Environment has one application
  * Can be cloned as a whole environment
  * Can rebuild environment - complete delete and rebuild
* **Environment tier**
  * Designates the type of application that the environment runs, and determines what resources Elastic Beanstalk provisions to support it
    * Type **Web server** environment tier
      * Represents a web application
    * Type **Worker** environment tier
      * Act upon output created by another environment - pulls work from SQS queue
        * Elastic Beanstalk is running a daemon process on each instance that reads from the queue
      * Ideal for long running workloads
      * Should only be loosely coupled to web server environments, eg. via *SQS*
      * Can also be invoked on a schedule (`cron.yml`)
* **Environment configuration**
  * Identifies a collection of parameters and settings that define how an environment and its associated resources behave
* **Saved configuration**
  * A template that you can use as a starting point for creating unique environment configurations
* **Platform**
  * Combination of an operating system, programming language runtime, web server, application server, and Elastic Beanstalk components

Configuration options, sorted by precedence:

##### Settings applied directly to the environment
Via console, eb-cli, ...

##### Existing configuration saved into `.elasticbeanstalk`
* Can use `eb config ...` to save/snapshot a configuration of an application
* Saved into `.elasticbeanstalk`
  * Only non-default values are being saved
  * Format is `*.cfg.yml`
* This can be modified, uploaded and applied
  * Good to backup existing applications
  * Can also be applied elsewhere, e.g. in a different region

##### `.ebextensions` in project
* *Folder* is part of application source bundle
* Allows granular configuration & customisation of the EB environment and its resources
* Contains `*.config` in *YAML* format with different sections like
* `option_settings`
  * Global configuration options
* `resources`
  * Specify additional resources, allows granular configuration of these
  * Put *CloudFormation* here, export *outputs* into beanstalk environment
    * Good for e.g. DDB table, SNS topic, ...
  * However, those resources are part of the *environment* and would be deleted with it
    * If this is not desired, then create resources independently
    * Usually best for e.g. databases
* `commands`
  * Executed on ec2 instance
  * Run before application and web server are being set up
* `container_commands`
  * Executed on ec2 instance
  * Affects application source code
  * Run after application archive has been extracted, but before application version has been deployed
  * Can use `leader_only` to only run on a single instance. E.g. migrate database
  * `packages`, `sources`, `files`, `users`, `groups`, `service`
		* Various *package managers* are being support (`yum`, `rubygems`, ...)
  * Applied with next `eb deploy`

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity
and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads. With the cloud, the
collection and aggregation of account and network activities is simplified, but it can be time
consuming for security teams to continuously analyze event log data for potential threats. With
GuardDuty, you now have an intelligent and cost-effective option for continuous threat detection
in the AWS Cloud. The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat
intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats. GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of
events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS log.
With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, GuardDuty can be enabled with no software or
hardware to deploy or maintain. By integrating with Amazon CloudWatch Events, GuardDuty alerts are
actionable, easy to aggregate across multiple accounts, and straightforward to push into existing
event management and workflow systems.

*AWS Lambda* lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the
compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can
run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration.
Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with
high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or
call it directly from any web or mobile app.

* Features
  * No
  servers
  * Continuous scaling
    * Cold Start - if no idle container is available to run the Lambda
  * Very cheap
  * Can give more RAM which will proportionaly increase CPU as well
* Supported languages
  * `nodejs`, `Java`, `C#/PowerShell`, `Python`, `Golang`, `Ruby`
* Can pass in *environment variables*
  * These can be KMS-encrypted as well (need SDK to decrypt)

<a name="4_22_2_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_2)[↓](#4_22_2_2) Versions
* If you work on a Lambda function, you work on `$LATEST`
* The system creates a new version of your Lambda function each time that you publish the function.
  The new version is a copy of the unpublished version of the function.
* Version is code *and* configuration
* Versions are immutable, you can change the function code and settings only on the unpublished
  version of a function.
* Each version gets its own ARN

<a name="4_22_2_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_2_1)[↓](#4_22_2_3) Aliases
* You can create one or more aliases for your AWS Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer
to a specific Lambda function *version*.
* Aliases are mutable
* Users can access the function version using the alias ARN.
* Can create e.g. `dev`, `test` and `prod`.
  * Aliases can point to multiple versions with a *weight* - for canary-style deployments

<a name="4_22_2_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_2_2)[↓](#4_22_2_4) Layers
* You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers.
* A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies.
* With layers, you can use libraries in your function without needing to include them in your deployment package.

<a name="4_22_2_4"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_2_3)[↓](#4_22_2_5) Network
* You can configure a function to connect to private subnets in a VPC in your account.
* Use VPC to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services.
* Connect your function to the VPC to access private resources during execution.
* Provisioning process for Lambda takes longer

<a name="4_22_2_5"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_2_4)[↓](#4_22_3) Database
* You can use the Lambda console to create an RDS database proxy for your function.
* A database proxy manages a pool of database connections and relays queries from a function.
* This enables a function to reach high concurrency levels without exhausting database connections.

<a name="4_22_3_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_3)[↓](#4_22_3_2) Synchronous/Asynchronous/Event Source Invocation
* When you invoke a function **synchronously**, Lambda runs the function and waits for a response.
  * -> API Gateway, ALB, Cognito, Lex, Alexa, CloudFront (Lambda@Edge), Kinesis Data Firehose
* When you invoke a function **asynchronously**, Lambda sends the event to a queue. A separate
process reads events from the queue and runs your function.
  * Lambda manages the function's asynchronous invocation queue and attempts to retry failed
  events automatically. If the function returns an error, Lambda attempts to run it two more times
  * When all attempts to process an asynchronous invocation fail, Lambda can send the event to an
  Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic.
  * -> S3, SNS, SES, CloudFormation, CloudWatch Logs & Events, CodeCommit, Config
* An **event source mapping** is an AWS Lambda resource that reads from an event source and invokes a Lambda function.
  * -> Kinesis, DynamoDB, SQS

<a name="4_22_3_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_3_1)[↓](#4_22_3_3) Function Scaling
* The first time you invoke your function, AWS Lambda creates an instance of the function and runs
its handler method to process the event.
  * When the function returns a response, it sticks around to process additional events.
  * If you invoke the function again while the first event is being processed, Lambda creates another instance.
  * This continues until there are enough instances to serve all requests, or a concurrency limit is reached.
  * When the number of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances to free up scaling capacity for other functions.
* **Concurrency** is `invocations/s * runtime` (eg. 10/s * 4s = 40)
  * Can configure *reservered concurrency*
    * No other function can use that concurrency
  * Can configure *provisioned concurrency* before an increase in invocations
    * Can ensure that all requests are served by initialized instances with very low latency.
* Default Burst concurrency limits
    * `3000` – US West (Oregon), US East (N. Virginia), Europe (Ireland)
    * `1000` – Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt)
    * `500` – Other Regions

<a name="4_22_3_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_22)[↑](#4_22_3_2)[↓](#4_23) Monitoring and troubleshooting
* AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions on your behalf and reports metrics through
  Amazon CloudWatch. To help you monitor your code as it executes, Lambda automatically tracks the
  *number of requests*, the *execution duration per request*, and the *number of requests that result in an error*.
* It also publishes the associated CloudWatch metrics.
* Need *custom metric* for memory usage

AWS License Manager makes it easier to manage your software licenses from software vendors such as
Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and IBM across AWS and on-premises environments. AWS License Manager lets
administrators create customized licensing rules that emulate the terms of their licensing
agreements, and then enforces these rules when an instance of EC2 gets launched. Administrators
can use these rules to help prevent licensing violations, such as using more licenses than an
agreement stipulates. The rules in AWS License Manager enable you to help prevent a licensing
breach by stopping the instance from launching or by notifying administrators about the
infringement. Administrators gain control and visibility of all their licenses with the AWS

### [↖](#4_26)[↑](#4_26_1)[↓](#4_26_3) Components
* **Stack**
  * Set of resources that are managed as a group
		* Need to enable *custom cookbooks*, this has to be enabled on stack level
* **Layer**
  * Represent and configure components of a stack
  * Share common configuration elements
  * E.g. load balancer layer, app layer, db layer
  * Type: *OpsWorks*, *ECS* or *RDS*
  * If a layer has *auto healing* enabled—the default setting—AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically replaces the layer's failed instances
		* After 5 minutes a non-responsive instance becomes *failed*.
* **Instance**
  * Units of compute within the platform
  * Must be associated with at least one layer
	* Linux or Windows, but not both
  * Can run
    * 24/7
    * Load-based
    * Time-based
		* Servers have to exist and to be pre-assigned to be e.g. load-based. So they are *not* created on demand.
* **App**
  * Applications that are deployed on one or more instances
  * Deployed through source code repo or S3
* **Deployments**
  * Deploy application code and related files to application server instances
  * Deployment operation is handled by each instance's Deploy recipes, which are determined by the instance's layer
	* Can *rollback* up to 4 versions

<a name="4_26_3"></a>
### [↖](#4_26)[↑](#4_26_2)[↓](#4_26_4) Lifecycle Events
* **Each layer** has a set of five lifecycle events, each of which has an associated set of recipes that are specific to the layer
* When an event occurs on a layer's instance, AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically runs the appropriate set of recipes

.|.

**Setup**|Occurs after a started instance has finished booting
**Configure**|Occurs on *all* of the stack's instances when one of the following occurs:<br/> * An instance enters or leaves the online state.<br/> * You associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or disassociate one from an instance.<br/> * You attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to a layer, or detach one from a layer.
**Deploy**|Occurs when you run a *Deploy* command.
**Undeploy**|Occurs when you run a *Undeploy* command
**Shutdown**|Occurs after you direct AWS OpsWorks Stacks to shut an instance down but before the associated Amazon EC2 instance is actually terminated.

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a
relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while
automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup,
patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast
performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.

Amazon RDS is available on several database instance types - optimized for memory, performance or I/O -
and provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora,
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server. You can use the AWS Database
Migration Service to easily migrate or replicate your existing databases to Amazon RDS.

<a name="4_31_2"></a>
### [↖](#4_31)[↑](#4_31_1)[↓](#4_31_3) Backups
* **Automated backups**
  * Enabled by default
  * Allow to recover database within a *retention period* (1d - 35d)
    * *Transactional* storage engine recommended as DB engine
    * Will take daily snapshot and use transaction logs
    * PITR down to 1 second (within retention period)
  * Backups are taken within defined window
    * Degrades performance if *multi-AZ* is not enabled!
    * Taken from slave if *multi-AZ* is enabled
  * Backups are stored internaly on S3
    * Free storage space equal to DB size
    * Deleting an instance deletes all *automated* backups
  * Cannot be shared with other accounts (need to be turned into *manual* snapshots first
* **Database Snapshots**
  * Only manually, always user initiated
  * Won't be deleted with DB instance

<a name="4_31_3"></a>
### [↖](#4_31)[↑](#4_31_2)[↓](#4_31_4) Multi-AZ deployments
Provide enhanced availability for database instances within a *single* AWS Region.

* Meant for *disaster recover*, not for performance improvement (-> Read Replica)
* Configure RDS for *multi-AZ deployments* and turn *replication* on
  * Keeps a **synchronous** standby replica in a different AZ
  * Automatic failover in case of planned or unplanned outage of the first AZ
    * Most likely still has downtime
    * Can *force* failover by *rebooting*
  * Other benefits
    * Patching
    * Backups
  * *Aurora* can replicate accross 3 AZs

<a name="4_31_4"></a>
### [↖](#4_31)[↑](#4_31_3)[↓](#4_32) Read replicas
* Read queries are routed to *read replicas*, reducing load on primary db instance (*source instance*)
* To create read replicas, AWS initally creates a snapshot of the source instance
  * Multi-AZ failover instance (if enabled) is used for snapshotting
  * After that all read queries are then **asynchronously** copied to read replica
  * Implies data latency, which typically is acceptable.
    * `ReplicaLag` can be monitored and *CloudWatch* alarms can be configured
  * No AWS charges for data replication in *same* region
* A single master can have **up to 5** read replicas
  * Can be in different regions
  * Can have Multi-AZ enabled themselves
* *Read replicas* are **not** the same as *multi-AZ failover* instances which
  * are *synchronously* updated
  * are designed to handle failover
  * don't receive any load unless failover actually happens
* Often it is beneficial to have both *read replicas* and *multi-AZ failover* instances
* Read replicas can be promoted to normal instances
  * E.g. use read replica to implement bigger changes on db level, after these have been finished promote to master instance
  * This will break replication

### [↖](#4_32)[↑](#4_32)[↓](#4_32_1_1) Overview
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can
use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing,
and health checking. If you choose to use Route 53 for all three functions, perform the steps in this order:

* Register domain names
  * Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Route 53 lets you register a name for your
  website or web application, known as a domain name.
* Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain
  * When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name (example.com) or subdomain name
  acme.example.com) in the address bar, Route 53 helps connect the browser with your website or web application.
* Check the health of your resources
  * Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to
  verify that it's reachable, available, and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources.

<a name="4_32_1_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_32)[↑](#4_32_1)[↓](#4_32_2) Terminology
* **Hosts** - Computers or services accessible within a domain
* **Name Server** - Translates domain names into IP addresses
* **Zone File** - Text file that contains mappings between domain names and IP addresses
* **Records** - Entries in zone file, mappings beween resources and names

<a name="4_32_2"></a>
### [↖](#4_32)[↑](#4_32_1_1)[↓](#4_32_2_1)  How it works

<a name="4_32_2_1"></a>
#### [↖](#4_32)[↑](#4_32_2)[↓](#4_32_2_2) Basic Flow
Root Server -> TLD Server -> Domain-Level Name Server -> Zone File

<a name="4_32_2_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_32)[↑](#4_32_2_1)[↓](#4_32_2_3) Zone File & Records
Zone file stores records. Various records exists:

Type|Definition|Example
-|-|-
**SOA**|State of Authority - Mandatory first entry, defines various things,<br/>eg name servers & admin contact|`ns1.dnsimple.com admin.dnsimple.com 2013022001 86400 7200 604800 300`
**A**|Map host name to ip4 address|`px01.vc.example.com.  198.51.100.40`
**AAAA**|Map host name to ip6 address|`px01.vc.example.com.  2a00:1450:4014:80c:0:0:0:2004`
**CNAME**|Defines alias for host name<br/>(maps one domain name to another)|`www.dnsimple.com. dnsimple.com.`
**MX**|Defines mail exchange|`example.com.  1800  MX  mail1.example.com.  10`
**PTR**|Maps ip4 address to host name (inverse to A record)|`10.27/1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.  1800  PTR mail.example.com.`
**SVR**|Points one domain to another domain name using a specific destination port|`_sip._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 5060 sipserver.example.com.`

Route53 specific:
* **Alias** record
  * Amazon Route 53 alias records provide a Route 53–specific extension to DNS functionality.
  Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as CloudFront distributions
  and Amazon S3 bucket. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another
  record.
  * Unlike a CNAME record, you can create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace, also
  known as the *zone apex*. For example, if you register the DNS name example.com, the zone apex is
  example.com. You can't create a CNAME record for example.com, but you can create an alias record
  for example.com that routes traffic to www.example.com
  * Preferred choice over CNAME (TODO: why?)

<a name="4_32_2_3"></a>
#### [↖](#4_32)[↑](#4_32_2_2)[↓](#4_33) Route53 Routing Policies
  * **Simple**
    * Default policy, typically used if only a single resource performs functionality
  * **Weighted**
    * Control distribution of traffic with DNS entries
      * This can be based on a certain percentage
      * Set *routing policy* to weighted (instead of failover)
  * **Latency**
    * Control distribution of traffic based on latency.
  * **Failover**
    * Can set up *health checks* for endpoints or domains from within *Route53*
      * Route 53 has health checkers in locations around the world. When you create a health check that
        monitors an endpoint, health checkers start to send requests to the endpoint that you specify
        to determine whether the endpoint is healthy.
      * `evaluate target health`
    * DNS entries are then being associated with health checks and can be configured to failover as
      well (1 primary and n secondary recordsets)
  * **Geolocation**
    * Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic
      location of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from. For example, you
      might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an ELB load balancer in the Frankfurt region.
  * **Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow Only)**
    * Geoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic
      location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or
      less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expands or shrinks the
      size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.
  * **Multivalue Answer Routing**
    * Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values, such as
    IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. You can specify multiple values for
    almost any record, but multivalue answer routing also lets you check the health of each resource,
    so Route 53 returns only values for healthy resources. It's not a substitute for a load balancer,
    but the ability to return multiple health-checkable IP addresses is a way to use DNS to improve
    availability and load balancing.

* **Effect** – This can be either allow or deny
* **Principal** – Account or user who is allowed access to the actions and resources in the statement
* **Actions** – For each resource, S3 supports a set of operations
* **Resources** – Buckets and objects are the resources
* Authorization works as a *union* of **IAM** & **bucket policies** and **bucket ACLs**

#### [↖](#4_33)[↑](#4_33_6)[↓](#4_33_6_2) Defaults
* Bucket is *owned* by the AWS account that created it
  * Ownership refers to the identity and email address used to create the account
	* Bucket ownership is not transferable
* Bucket owner gets full permission (ACL)
* The person paying the bills always has full control.
* A person uploading an object into a bucket owns it by default.

<a name="4_33_6_2"></a>
#### [↖](#4_33)[↑](#4_33_6_1)[↓](#4_33_6_3) IAM
* IAM policies (in general) specify what actions are allowed or denied on what AWS resources
* Defined as JSON
* Attached to IAM users, groups, or roles (so they cannot grant access to anonymous users)
* Use if you’re more interested in *“What can this user do in AWS?”*

attached to
* Defined as JSON
* Attached *only* to S3 buckets. Can however effect object in buckets.
* Contain *principal* element (unnecessary for IAM)
* Use if you’re more interested in *“Who can access this S3 bucket?”*
* Easiest way to grant *cross-account permissions* for all `s3:*` permission. (Cannot do this with ACLs.)

	* control access to object uploaded into a bucket from a *different* account.
* Cannot..
	* have conditions
	* cannot explicitely deny actions
	* grant permission to bucket sub-resources (eg. lifecycle or static website configurations)
* Other than *object ACL*s there are *bucket ACL*s as well - only for writing access log objects to a
bucket.

### [↖](#4_34)[↑](#4_34)[↓](#4_34_2) Overview
AWS Secrets Manager helps you protect secrets needed to access your applications, services, and IT
resources. The service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials,
API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets
with a call to Secrets Manager APIs, eliminating the need to hardcode sensitive information in
plain text. Secrets Manager offers secret rotation with built-in integration for Amazon RDS,
Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DocumentDB. Also, the service is extensible to other types of secrets,
including API keys and OAuth tokens. In addition, Secrets Manager enables you to control access to
secrets using fine-grained permissions and audit secret rotation centrally for resources in the
AWS Cloud, third-party services, and on-premises.
* Allows for easier rotation than SSM Parameter Store
* Can trigger Lambda
* Deeply integrates into RDS

AWS Step Functions is a web service that enables you to coordinate the components of distributed
applications and microservices using visual workflows. You build applications from individual
components that each perform a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and change
applications quickly.

Step Functions provides a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of
your application. Step Functions offers a graphical console to visualize the components of your
application as a series of steps. It automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when
there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected, every time. Step
Functions logs the state of each step, so when things go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly.

Step Functions manages the operations and underlying infrastructure for you to ensure your
application is available at any scale.

<a name="4_36_4"></a>
### [↖](#4_36)[↑](#4_36_3)[↓](#4_36_5) Error handling
* By default, when a state reports an error, AWS Step Functions causes the execution to fail entirely.
* `Task` and `Parallel` states can have a field named Retry, whose value must be an array of objects known as *retriers*.
* An individual retrier represents a certain number of retries, usually at increasing time intervals.

  * MaxAttempts (Optional)
  * BackoffRate (Optional)

<a name="4_36_5"></a>
### [↖](#4_36)[↑](#4_36_4)[↓](#4_37) Best Practices
* Use Timeouts to Avoid Stuck Executions
  * Specify a reasonable timeout when you create a task in your state machine
* Use ARNs Instead of Passing Large Payloads
* Avoid Reaching the History Quota
  * Hard quota of 25,000 entries in the execution history. To avoid reaching this quota for long-running executions, implement a pattern that uses an AWS Lambda function that can start a new execution of your state machine to split ongoing work across multiple workflow executions
* Handle Lambda Service Exceptions
  * Lambda can occasionally experience transient service errors - proactively handle these exceptions in your state machine
* Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks
* Choosing Standard or Express Workflows
  * Choose Standard Workflows when you need long-running, durable, and auditable workflows,
  * Choose Express Workflows for high-volume, event processing workloads.
